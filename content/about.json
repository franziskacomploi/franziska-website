  "text": "Hi, I'm Fran! The year 2020 probably held a huge transition for a lot of us and it was no different for me. After I finished my universtity in 2018, I moved to Berlin and worked in Marketing at different Start-ups. A few years later I was rethinking my career and dedicated myself to learn coding. After only 3 months, I got myslef a new job. Now I'm a Software Engineer that is curious about trends, research and what happens in our world."
