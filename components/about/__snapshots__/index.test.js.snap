      Hi, I'm Fran! The year 2020 probably held a huge transition for a lot of us and it was no different for me. After I finished my universtity in 2018, I moved to Berlin and worked in Marketing at different Start-ups. A few years later I was rethinking my career and dedicated myself to learn coding. After only 3 months, I got myslef a new job. Now I'm focusing on cloud, data & engineering, as well as sustainabable approaches.
