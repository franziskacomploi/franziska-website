            The year 2020 probably held a huge transition for a lot of us. Same for me. I used to work as a Content Manager and now turned into a Software Developer with a passion for building amazing products.
            My motivation comes from tasks fueled by passion and big dreams! When I set myself the goal to learn something new, I got myself a job in only 3 months. And I'm still learning new things everyday.
