            The year 2020 probably hold a huge transition for a lot of us. Same for me. I used to work as a Content Manager and now turned Software Developer with a passion for green & responsible Tech.
            My motivation comes from passionate tasks and dreaming big! When I set myself the goal to learn coding, I got myself a job after only 3 month. And I'm still studying coding everyday.
